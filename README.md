I am a front-end developer with a strong commitment to UI excellence, rigorous testing, and comprehensive documentation. My expertise centers on building efficient, reusable web components, with a deep focus on Stencil.js for planning, styling, implementation, and extensive testing. I prioritize reusability and testability in every component, ensuring that each one meets stringent standards for performance, accessibility, and reliability.

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding into backend development with Express.js to grow my capabilities as a full-stack developer.
